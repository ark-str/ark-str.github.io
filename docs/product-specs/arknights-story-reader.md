# Arknights Story Reader

Status: active
Phase: design system foundation

## Product Goal

Build a web application that makes Arknights story content easier to read, summarize, and browse without requiring runtime network access.

## Main Pages

- Home / onboarding
- Reader
- Character information

## Reader Expectations

- organize navigation by locale, narrative grouping, and stage or story
- show dialogue with speaker portrait, name, and line text
- show Doctor choice branches with their resulting dialogue
- include story summaries alongside the raw script

## Character Information Expectations

- start empty for a new user
- unlock facts progressively as the user reads stories
- persist discovered facts and progress in `localStorage`

## Data and Pipeline Expectations

- upstream raw data comes from GitHub-managed sources under `vendor/`
- runtime reads only bundled assets generated into `ark-str-web-app/public/generated/`
- summaries and unlock facts are produced ahead of time through scripts
- already-summarized stories must be tracked so unchanged stories are skipped

## Runtime Constraints

- App Router only
- bundled resources only
- no runtime external fetches
- local storage only for mutable user state
- repository root owns the harness and `ark-str-web-app/` owns the runnable app

## Current Phase

This phase still does not implement the full reader. It establishes:

- root-level design-system docs for principles, tokens, components, and voice
- semantic light/dark theme tokens in the nested app
- shared UI primitives under `ark-str-web-app/src/components/ui/`
- app-owned theme persistence and a bootstrap shell that uses the new primitives
- mechanical guardrails that keep runtime colors centralized in the token source
